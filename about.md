## How to contribute / add my publications?

### Step 1: Add your `bibtex` file to `./publications/***.bib`

We provide different categories according to the EDA flow, please copy your bibtex to the corresponding category.

<table class="table table-hover">
    <tr>
        <td><b>Category</b></td>
        <td><b>File</b></td>
        <td><b>notes</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Architechture Design</td>
        <td><code>arch.bib</code></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Placement</td>
        <td><code>place.bib</code></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Design for Manufacutring</td>
        <td><code>dfm.bib</code></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>

The categories are defined in `pub.yaml` of repo: [awesome-AI4EDA](https://github.com/ai4eda/awesome-AI4EDA), you can also submit new categories to `pub.yaml` or contact [cgjcuhk@gmail.com](mailto:cgjcuhk@gmail.com) to help you add the categories. 

```yaml
# pub.yaml
categories_publications:
  name: "All publications"
  group_by_topic: True
  categories:
    -
      heading: "Architechture Design"
      file: arch.bib
      prefix: ''
    -
      heading: "Placement"
      file: place.bib
      prefix: ''
    -
      heading: "Design for Manufacutring"
      file: dfm.bib
      prefix: ''
```

### Step 2: Add the topic for your pub in the bibtex file.

Example: üëáüèª the `_venue`, `year`, `topic` fileds are required. You publication will be displayed into the corresponding topic.

You can also add `url` filed to attach the paper link. 
And the `abstract` filed to add the paper abstract.

```bibtex
@inproceedings{DAC23_Nitho,
  title={Physics-Informed Optical Kernel Regression Using Complex-valued Neural Fields},
  author={Chen, Guojin and Pei, Zehua and Yang, Haoyu and Ma, Yuzhe and Yu, Bei and Wong, Martin},
  booktitle={ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference,  (\textbf{DAC '23})},
  _venue={DAC},
  year={2023},
  topic = {Lithography},
  url = {link to your paper},
  abstract = {abstract of your paper}
}
```
