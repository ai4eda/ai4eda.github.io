I sign and encrypt emails with PGP, which means my emails
have a signature attached verifying that the message was sent
by me and not somebody else.
This signature is often shown by mail clients without
PGP as `noname` because the attachment doesn't have a filename.
Please download my key from [here](/data/bdamos_pgp.asc)
or from any [SKS OpenPGP Keyserver](http://keyserver.cns.vt.edu/),
and do get in contact if you would like to exchange signatures.
